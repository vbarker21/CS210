This project involves building an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. The program analyzes the text records generated by the store throughout the day, listing items purchased in chronological order.
The main objective is to determine the frequency of item purchases to optimize the layout of the produce section. By understanding which items are purchased more frequently, the store can strategically position them for customer convenience. 

What I think I did well:
1. The program efficiently analyzes the text records and provides a summary of item purchase frequencies.
2. The code is structured to handle large volumes of data and is scalable.
3. The program provides actionable insights for optimizing the produce section layout.

Areas for Enhancement:
1. Code Efficiency: The program can be enhanced by implementing algorithms or data structures that improve the efficiency of analyzing the records. 
2. Security: Implementing appropriate security measures, such as input validation and data encryption, would enhance the security of the program.
3. User Interface: Adding a better user interface to input the text records and display the results would improve the usability of the program and make it more user-friendly.

Challenges:
The one challenging aspect of the code was to efficiently parse and analyze large volumes of text records. To overcome this, I have tried different approaches to see what worked best from my point of view.

Tools and Resources:
I think documentation and tutorials are very valuable part of learning. Referencing programming language documentation has been utmost helpful. There are also various online forums available where more experienced developers
help others by teaching them how to code a certain requirement. 

Skills that I have gained from this project that can be applied to other projects or coursework:
1. Data analysis and manipulation
2. Algorithmic thinking
3. Software design and architecture

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I tried to do the following:
1. Code organization: I wanted to make sure that my code was sound, organized and easily readable.
2. Documentation: I did not include comments, but based on feedback I should have done that and will keep in mind in the future.
3. Error handling: Testing and testing often to resolve any errors early on.
4. Configurability: Designing the program to be easily configurable.
